# TextMountain: Accurate Scene Text Detection via Instance Segmentation

## Introduction
This is the code of TextMountain. It is modified based on [semantic-segmentation-pytorch](https://github.com/CSAILVision/semantic-segmentation-pytorch).

## Requirements
* Python 3.6.1
* opencv-python 3.4.4
* torch 0.4.0
* Install other required packages according to the error message

## Compiling grouping code
Our grouping code is based on [RoIAlign.pytorch](https://github.com/longcw/RoIAlign.pytorch)
```
cd groupSearch
bash make.sh
cd ..
cd groupmeanScore/
bash make.sh
```

## Training
We package labels in roidb_mlt.pik and roidb_ctw.pik. If you want to train with your own dataset, you can refer to our packaging format and make a new annotation file.
```
python train_ctw.py
python train_mlt.py
```

## Evaluation
The model trained on MLT can be download through the following link:
